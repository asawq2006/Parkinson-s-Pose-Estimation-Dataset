# Parkinson's Pose Estimation Dataset

This notebook describes the dataset accompanying the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09416">'Vision-Based Assessment of Parkinsonism and Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia with Deep Learning Pose Estimation'</a> - Li, Mestre, Fox, Taati (2017).

The dataset is available <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/BabakTaati/Data/PD/UDysRS_UPDRS_Export.zip">here</a>.

The data includes all movement trajectories extracted from the videos of Parkinson's assessments using Convolutional Pose Machines (CPM) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134), as well as the confidence values from CPM. The dataset also includes ground truth ratings of parkinsonism and dyskinesia severity using the UDysRS, UPDRS, and CAPSIT.
